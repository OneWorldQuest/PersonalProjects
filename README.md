# ðŸŒŸ My Personal Projects Repo ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the One World Quest collection of simple web projects! This repository is a home for small, **static websites** built using **HTML** and **CSS**. The projects will be displayed [here](https://oneworldquest.click/) for future reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is This Repository For?

**This repository serves a few important purposes:**

### 1. A Digital Portfolio (Your Resume for Code)
Think of this repository as a **digital portfolio** or an online resume that shows off your coding skills. As you learn and grow, having a place to demonstrate your work is essential! When you apply for a course, an internship, or even a future job, being able to say "Here, check out what I've built!" is incredibly powerful.

### 2. Practice, Practice, Practice!
The best way to learn to code is by building things. This repository encourages **hands-on practice** with the foundational technologies of the web:
* **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The "skeleton" or structure of a webpage. It determines what content is there (headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.).
* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** The "skin" and "style" of a webpage. It makes the site look good (colors, fonts, layouts, animations, etc.).

### 3. Version Control and Collaboration
By keeping your projects in a repository like this, you're learning to use **Git** and **GitHub**. These are the industry-standard tools for **version control** (tracking changes over time) and **collaboration** (working with others). Even for solo projects, tracking your history is crucial!

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The organization of this repository is simple and clean. Each folder belongs to one person and contains *their* complete website project.

| Folder Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `README.md` | This file! (Explains the whole repository). |
| `student-a-name` | The static website project built by Student A. |
| `student-b-name` | The static website project built by Student B. |

**To view a project:** Just click on one of the folders above! Inside, you'll find an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file (or similar) which make up the website.
